## üìÇ Repository Structure and Instructions

The repository is organized by subjects and topics covered during the first semester. Each subject contains detailed notes, example problems, and additional resources.

### üìò Courses/Subjects

#### **Mathematics - MT 101: Calculus I (3 Credit Hours)**
**Instructions:**

This course should be manageable if you've put in good effort in college mathematics, especially for Federal Board (FBISE) students, as the content is similar. Since it's a 3-credit hour course, it can significantly affect your grade. Practice daily and use verified solutions for *Calculus: Early Transcendentals* by James Stewart, available on Quizlet.

---

#### **Computer Science - CS 101: Computing and Artificial Intelligence (3 Credit Hours)**
**Instructions:**

If you haven't learned programming in college, you'll need to invest time and effort in this course (2 credit hours theory + 1 credit hour lab). It introduces programming in C++. Enhance your problem-solving skills by learning to code from YouTube channels like *Apna College by Shradha Khapra* or the *CS50x course by David Malan* (Harvard University).

---

#### **Applied Chemistry and Environment - CH 101 (2 Credit Hours)**
**Instructions:**

**Pre-mid:** The content can be tricky. Understand and practice numerical problems discussed in class and lecture slides. Numerical problems can be redesigned by reverse engineering, so focus on problem-solving methods. Attend lectures attentively for important short questions.

**Post-mid:** Content is mostly theoretical. Learn thoroughly as theoretical questions are common. Pay attention to any numerical/mathematical problems for final preparation.

---

#### **Applied Physics - PH 101: Applied Physics and Labs (4 Credit Hours)**
**Instructions:**

This 3-credit hour course (plus 1 credit for the lab) covers applied physics. A-level students with a strong physics background may find this manageable, but FSC students might need additional effort. Consistent practice of numerical problems is key.

For the lab component, follow the weekly procedures carefully, as exams often require replicating them accurately. Weekly tasks are conducted in a single 3-hour session. You can request extra practice before exams with your instructor's permission.
