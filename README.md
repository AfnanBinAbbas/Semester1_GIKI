# Semester One Notes and Resources:

Welcome to the Semester One Notes repository! This repository is dedicated to providing comprehensive notes and resources for students embarking on their first semester in Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute, Topi, Swabi-KPK Pakistan. These materials aim to help juniors navigate their academic journey with ease and confidence.

Note: This repository tends to address only the courses/subjects that have a higher difficulty level.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different subjects and topics covered during the first semester. Each subject contains detailed notes, example problems, and additional resources.

### Courses/Subjects

**Mathematics - MT 101**
  - Calculus I (3 Credit Hour)

Instructions: This course isn't a tough call if your someone whose put good efforts in their college mathematics, especially for the fedaral board students the contents are quite similar to what they would had already studied. It is a 3 credit hour course meaning it can highly affect your grade, therefore give daily practice to everything you study in class. Get verified and trustworthy solutions to your course-book: "Calculus: Early Transcendentals by James Stewart" problems from Quizlet, an online web application with solutions to various textbook problems.


**Computer Science - CS 101**
  - Computing and Artificial Intelligence (3 Credit Hour)

Instructions: If your someone who hasn't learned to program in their college, then you would really need to put the time and efforts to achieve a good grade in this 2 credit hour course(1 Credit hour for CS101-LAB). This course is the basis of your CS journey as it introduces you to the programming in C++ language.
Enhance your problem solving skills by learning how to code on either youtube from the famous channel of Shradha Khapra named "Apna College", or you can also learn to code in C language from David Malan in his famous CS50x course offered for free by Harvard University. Although it would be C programming language; David Malan's course would be really benefitial in developing your problem solving skills.



**Applied Chemistry and Environment - CH 101**
-Applied Chemistry and Environment (2 Credit Hour)

Instructions: The pre mid contents of this course could be really tricky, however it can be dealt easily if one puts in efforts to the numerical problems being discussed in class and the lecture slides. Always practice those numerical problems, find related ones from the suggested course books. Another important aspect to keep in mind is that a numerical problem can be redesigned by reverse engineering, meaning your answer and the question statement interchanges, therefore give good attention to the way one question is being solved. Furthermore, short questions are also expected from slides and mostly important ones are announced by the lecturer in the class, therefore it is advisable to be attentive during the lecture.

The post-mid content is not relatively tricky as it is mostly based on theory and learning. It is advisable to learn as much content as you can, as mostly theoretical questions are expected. However any numerical/mathematical problem should also be subjected to great importance for Final preparation
