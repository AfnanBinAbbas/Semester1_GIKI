# Semester One Notes and Resources

Welcome to the Semester One Notes repository! This repository provides comprehensive notes and resources for students at Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute, Topi, Swabi-KPK Pakistan. These materials aim to help juniors navigate their academic journey with ease and confidence.

Note: This repository addresses only courses with a higher difficulty level.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by subjects and topics covered during the first semester. Each subject contains detailed notes, example problems, and additional resources.

### Courses/Subjects

**Mathematics - MT 101**
  - **Calculus I (3 Credit Hours)**

Instructions: 

This course should be manageable if you've put in good efforts in college mathematics, especially for Federal Board (FBISE) students, as the content is similar. Since it's a 3 credit hour course, it can significantly affect your grade. Practice daily and use verified solutions for "Calculus: Early Transcendentals" by James Stewart available on Quizlet.

**Computer Science - CS 101**
  - **Computing and Artificial Intelligence (3 Credit Hours)**

Instructions: 

If you haven't learned to program in college, you'll need to invest time and effort in this 2 credit hour course (plus 1 credit hour for the lab). This course introduces programming in C++. Enhance your problem-solving skills by learning to code from YouTube's "Apna College" by Shradha Khapra or Harvard University's CS50x course by David Malan, which, although in C, is excellent for developing problem-solving skills.

**Applied Chemistry and Environment - CH 101**
  - **Applied Chemistry and Environment (2 Credit Hours)**

Instructions: 

*Pre-mid:* The content can be tricky. Understand and practice numerical problems discussed in class and lecture slides. Numerical problems can be redesigned by reverse engineering, so pay attention to problem-solving methods. Attend lectures attentively for important short questions.

*Post-mid:* Content is mostly theoretical. Learn thoroughly as theoretical questions are common. Give importance to any numerical/mathematical problems for final preparation.
